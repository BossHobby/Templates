# Templates
Quickstart templates for QUICKSILVER

* Templates are available within the configurator for some bnf models. There are also tunes for specific builds.
* Apply a template as part of setting up a fresh flash if applicable.

# Creating a template
**All files must be named the same and begin either /tune or /setup**

* Set up the build to your requirements then save a profile. Edit the .yaml file to only contain the necessary settings for your template.
Save as /***the name of your template***/profile.yaml
* Create a new file with a line for name and a line for description like so
Start the first line with /***name:*** and the second line with ***desc:*** 
Save the file as ***the name of your template***/index.yaml
* Add an image .jpg and save as /***the name of your template***/image.jpg
* Create a pull request and include the files you just created.
